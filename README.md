# RESTful-APIs-for-Bookstore-application

This coursework is designed to provide you with practical experience in designing and 
implementing RESTful web services using the Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS). 
You will build a comprehensive "Bookstore" application API, gaining hands-on experience 
with core RESTful principles, JAX-RS features, and common API design patterns. 
This project simulates a real-world scenario where you need to create a robust and 
scalable backend API to manage various entities like books, authors, customers, shopping 
carts, and orders. You'll learn how to structure your application using resource classes, 
handle different HTTP methods, process requests and responses, and implement proper 
error handling.
